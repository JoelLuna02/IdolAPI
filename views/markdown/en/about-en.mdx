IdolAPI is a RESTful API based on the VTubers's Israeli agency Idol Corp. Here you will have access to information
about your favorite vtubers, staff, songs, etc., in addition to having access to images. Remember that for more
information you can consult the documentation, where you will learn how this API works and its available methods.

### **What's an API?**

*A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) 
that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with
RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by
computer scientist Roy Fielding.*

An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. 
It’s sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information 
user—establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by
the producer (the response). For example, the API design for a weather service could specify that 
the user supply a zip code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the
high temperature, and the second being the low.  

In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform
a function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can understand and fulfill
the request.

## **Present yourself! who are you?**

Without further delays, i'm Joel Luna, A beginner full stack web developer, 
currently a university student of software engineering, and a fan of the VTuber world.

## **What motivated you to build this?**

I have always wanted to create a small but powerful API server aimed at novice programmers and students who want to enter the 
world of web programming. and what better way to do it than with the Idol Corp VTubers.

## **Technology stack**

This project is developed through node.js, using Express.js as a backend development framework, JWT to implement authentication
through credentials, GraphQL to perform queries and mutations, and Handlebars for client-side rendering.

It also has MongoDB, to be able to store information and bytes in a NoSQL type database

The production database is deployed in MongoDB Atlas and the application is deployed from Vercel.
