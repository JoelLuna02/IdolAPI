In this section you will be able to see the functionality of each and every one of the available
resources. To exemplify its operation, we use JavaScript for its consumption. You can
use any other programming language or client to return data.

## Base url

We have defined the base url as [`/api`](/api), which contains information about the available API resources.
The requests are made with the **GET** method and its response will return information in **json** format.

When making a request to the url, the response will return the following:

```json
{
  "vtuber": "/api/vtuber",
  "hashtag": "/api/hashtag",
  "social": "/api/social",
  "assets": "/api/assets",
  "auth": "/api/auth"
}
```

## GraphQL

You can access the graphql console from [here](/gql)

Let's see a small example of a GraphQL query:
```graphql
query {

  # Full List of vtubers
  vtuber: {
    _id fullname fanname branch unit
  }

  # Get VTuber by ID
  getVTuber(ID: "An VTuber ID") {
    _id fullname fanname branch unit
  }
}
```

The result that it returns is this:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "vtuber": [
      {
        "_id": "# The Vtuber's ID",
        "fullname": "# The VTuber's Full Name",
      },
      // ...
    ]
  }
}
```

You can see more query functions in our GraphQL console. If you are new to this, you can go to the GraphQL documentation [here](https://graphql.org/learn/).
