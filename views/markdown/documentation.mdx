In this section you will be able to see the functionality of each and every one of the available
resources. To exemplify its operation, we use JavaScript for its consumption. You can
use any other programming language or client to return data.

## **Base url**

We have defined the base url as [`/api`](/api), which contains information about the available API resources.
The requests are made with the `GET` method and its response will return information in `json` format.

Let's try the request via JavaScript:

```javascript
fetch('https://idolapi.vercel.app/api')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((json) => console.log(json));
```

**The output it will return is this:**

```json
{
    "vtuber": "/api/vtuber",
    "agency": "/api/agency",
    "assets": "/api/assets",
    "auth": "/api/auth"
}
```

Next, we are going to explain the function of each of the resources:

- [vtuber](/api/vtuber): This resource is used to obtain a list of all Vtubers
- [agency](/api/agency): This resource is used to obtain detailed information from the Idol Agency.
- [assets](/api/assets): This resource is used to obtain a list of all the images stored in the database.
- [auth](/api/auth): This resource is used to register and log in to manage protected resources.
