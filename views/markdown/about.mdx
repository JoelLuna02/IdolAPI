IdolAPI is a RESTful API based on the VTuber agency Isrealí Idol Corp. Here you will have access to information about your favorite vtubers, staff, songs, etc., in addition to having access to images. Remember that for more information you can consult the documentation, where you can access how this API works and its available methods.

### **What's an API?**

*A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) 
that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with
RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by
computer scientist Roy Fielding.*

An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. 
It’s sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information 
user—establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by
the producer (the response). For example, the API design for a weather service could specify that 
the user supply a zip code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the
high temperature, and the second being the low.  

In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform
a function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can understand and fulfill
the request.
